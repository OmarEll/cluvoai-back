            Interviewer: Can you walk me through the last time you experienced problems with meal planning?
            
            Sarah: Oh wow, just this week actually. It was Sunday evening and I realized I had no idea what we were going to eat for the week. The kids were asking what's for dinner tomorrow, and I just felt this overwhelming stress. I ended up spending 2 hours that night trying to figure out meals, checking what we had in the fridge, making a grocery list. It's just so time-consuming.
            
            Interviewer: What's the most frustrating part about your current meal planning process?
            
            Sarah: The mental load, honestly. It's not just the planning - it's remembering everyone's preferences, checking what we already have, making sure it's somewhat healthy, staying within budget. My husband always says "just order pizza" but that gets expensive and I feel guilty about not feeding my kids properly.
            
            Interviewer: How much time does this problem cost you per week?
            
            Sarah: Between the actual planning, grocery shopping with two kids in tow, and the stress of figuring out what to cook each day? I'd say easily 4-5 hours. And that's just the time - the mental energy is exhausting.
            
            Interviewer: What have you tried before that didn't work?
            
            Sarah: I've tried those meal planning apps but they're so generic. I tried meal kit services but they're too expensive for our budget. Pinterest has great ideas but then I have to figure out the grocery list myself. I even tried planning a month ahead once but life happens - kids get sick, work gets crazy, and the plan goes out the window.
            
            Interviewer: On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this for you?
            
            Sarah: Definitely an 8 or 9. It affects our whole family's stress level. When I'm stressed about meals, everyone feels it. My kids end up eating more processed foods, we waste money on last-minute takeout, and I feel like I'm failing as a mom.
            
            Interviewer: What would an ideal solution look like?
            
            Sarah: Something that actually learns our family's preferences, considers our budget, maybe even knows what's on sale at our grocery store. Something that can adapt when plans change. And honestly, if it could just take the decision-making away from me while still being healthy and budget-friendly, that would be amazing.
